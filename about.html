                    <h2>My name is Anna Weddle.</h2>
                    <p>I am a freelance designer, illustrator, and photographer currently bouncing between Indianapolis and Muncie, Indiana. For the past few years, I've worked with clients in a very hands-on work environment. The Digital Corps helped me work in a collaborative team with people from many different disciplines such as development and video, helped me establish good design habits and gave me real world experience while in college.</p>
                    <p>Once I graduate from Ball State University in 2018, I have got my sights set on working for a design studio. I have flirted with the idea of settling anywhere from New York to Alaska to Australia. </p>
					<p>So far, my portfolio includes illustration and coding work to create <a href="eft.html">an educational app</a> used by thousands of students in Indiana to celebrate the state's bicenntennial, branding work for <a href="tcm.html">Turner Classic Movies</a>, a <a href="indien.html">band</a>, and a successful personal project <a href="funcie.html">Funcie</a> in which I created a logo for my town and successfully marketed it as merchandise and a Snapchat geofilter, earning me Millenial cred. I have also designed multiple apps and websites as well as countless web and print materials for Ball State University as well as rebranding for various University offices.</p>
                    <p>I want to continue designing work in the public sphere and working to improve the environment I live in through design.</p>
<!--                    <p>I firmly believe in the art of asking (and asking again), and the importance of teaching yourself. (I taught myself to code and now look at this sparkly website.) I never want to stop learning and branching out to new mediums and methods.</p>-->
                    <p>Thank you for checking out my work, I would love to hear from you! I am always accepting freelance and looking for new opportunities.</p>
