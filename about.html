                    <h2>My name is Anna Weddle.</h2>
					<p>I am a freelance designer, <a href="illustration.html">illustrator</a>, and <a href="photography.html">photographer</a> currently in Indianapolis. I love travel, art, and reading about art and travel.</p>
					<p>For the past few years, I've worked with clients in a very hands-on work environment. The Digital Corps helped me work in a collaborative team with people from many different disciplines such as development and video, helped me establish good design habits and gave me real world experience while in college.</p>
					<p>So far, my portfolio includes branding for a <a href="branding.html">band</a>, and a personal project <a href="funcie.html">Funcie</a> in which I created a logo for my town and successfully marketed it as merchandise and a Snapchat geofilter, earning me Millenial cred. I have also designed multiple apps and websites as well as countless web and print materials for Ball State University as well as rebranding for various University offices. I've also used personal projects to develop my <a href="photography.html">Photography</a>, <a href="colortheory.html">Art Direction</a>, and <a href="animation.html">Animation</a>. I've also included in my portfolio some Fine Art work such as <a href="neon.html">Sculpture</a> pieces I made for a Neon class.</p>
					<p>I use design to talk about issues that are important to me such as <a>feminism</a> and to solve problems in my <a href="riverside.html">community</a>. I want to continue challenging myself, and working to improve my environment through design.</p>
<!--                    <p>I firmly believe in the art of asking (and asking again), and the importance of teaching yourself. (I taught myself to code and now look at this sparkly website.) I never want to stop learning and branching out to new mediums and methods.</p>-->
                    <p>Thank you for checking out my work, I would love to hear from you! I am always accepting freelance and looking for new opportunities.</p>
