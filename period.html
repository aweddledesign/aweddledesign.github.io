                   <h2>Normalize Periods</h2>
                   
					<p>My Junior year, I was able to design for a cause I was very passionate about. I made packaging that promotes destigmatizing periods. I wanted to encourage people to not feel embarrassed about natural processes a body goes through. No one should feel embarrassed talking about periods or buying those products. I was asked to make packaging for tampons for a class project, and I got excited and made a whole period survival kit.</p>
