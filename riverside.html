                   <h2>Riverside Neighborhood Branding</h2>
                   
                   <p>I worked with residents of Riverside Normal City Neighborhood to help them brand the town, which is known for it's many different styles of houses, a strip of local businesses called the village, and concert venues right off Ball State Universities campus. I got to know the town when I lived there during college and I loved working with the residents to design a plan for thier neighborhood. I designed a logo that could appear in print, digitally, and on a wooden sign that welcomed people to the neighborhood. I also worked as a design consultant, guiding residents of the neighborhood and providing technical skill to help them design and install neighborhood crosswalks.</p>
