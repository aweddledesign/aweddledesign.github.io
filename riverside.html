			<h2>Creative Crosswalks</h2>
			
			<p class="description">Creative Crosswalks was a project that the city of Muncie started to increase awareness of the different neighborhoods and what they have to offer in Muncie. <a href="http://muncieactionplan.net/creative-crosswalks-coming-to-a-muncie-neighborhood-near-you/" target="_blank">Read more about the Creative Crosswalks project from Muncie Action Plan here!</a> <a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2016/10/nli-neighborhood-association" target="_blank">Read about the project from the Ball State Daily News here!</a> I was a designer for Riverside Normal City Neighborhood. Working with the neighborhood association, the Ball State Architecture school, and Muncie Arts and Culture Council, we designed a logo and a crosswalk that highlighted the music venues, restaurants, and cultural offerings of the neighborhood. The project consisted of identity design and painting crosswalks in the neighborhood.
