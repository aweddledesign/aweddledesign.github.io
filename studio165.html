                   <h2>Studio 165+</h2>
                   <p>Studio 165+ is the name of the design seminar I was a part of as a Junior. The class made identity, print, and digital design for clients from outside of Ball State such as Muncie Arts and Culture Council, the Facing Project, and WCRD. We chose the name Studio 165+ because we spent 165 minutes in every class, plus the extra time we spent working outside of class. I made a logo concept for the class that turns the numbers into an abstract, modern symbol and fills it with patterns. I used green as the colors in the brand because, as students, we are “green” or new to the industry. The symbol can stand alone and with the text. This project consisted of identity design, including icons for a future website.</p>
