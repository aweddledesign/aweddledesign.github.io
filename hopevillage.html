			<p>Hope Village is a community in Somalia that houses refugees who are there to escape the political instability and violence in the region. I worked remotely with a class at Yale that was working with women from the village to help them build businesses to support themselves. The women make baskets, sandals, jams, and honeys that would be exported and sold so that the women could support themselves. I worked with the class on a freelance basis to design labels for products that the village produced for export. I consulted with a professor in Chicago who specializes in the study of languages for help with Arabic and Somali translations. I researched the country and received feedback on cultural imagery. Through their feedback, I changed the illustration so that the dress covered her arms, I altered the head wrap, and I changed the dress so that it was not green, since that is not a color that is often worn there.
