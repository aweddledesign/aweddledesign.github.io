			<h2>Gym App</h2>
			
			<p class="description">During my training at the Digital Corps, I was told to design something that I felt would improve the University so I chose to make the gym schedules more accessible and to more clearly advertise the services offered there with an app. Currently, gym schedules are displayed via pdfs that are only easily accessed from a computer. I designed an app that would be simple and clear with schedules, classes, and hours readily available in the users pocket. The app encourages the user to stay active by tracking how much they go to the gym and helping them set and reach goals.
